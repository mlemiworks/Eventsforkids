# Lasten tapahtumat

A children's events listing site built as an exercise in AI-assisted development — specifically using Claude Code as an agent to build a real Next.js project from scratch. The stack is Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, NextAuth v4, and Tailwind CSS v4.

Anyone can browse events. Only registered and logged-in users can create, edit, or delete their own events. Admins can manage all events.

Live demo: https://lasten-tapahtumat.onrender.com — free hosting, so give it a sec.
